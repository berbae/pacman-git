This is my version of a pacman-git PKGBUILD.

It is a modification of the falconindy's one in AUR found at https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=29937

To build the package, these files should be present in the build directory:

PKGBUILD
pacman.conf
pacman.conf.x86_64
makepkg.conf
pacman.install

They are contained in the pacman-git.tar.gz file.

In PKGBUILD edit the pkgver and/or the pkgrel variables for each new build.

Then use the command:

makepkg --holdver --log

And install the pacman-git and pacman-git-contrib packages.
